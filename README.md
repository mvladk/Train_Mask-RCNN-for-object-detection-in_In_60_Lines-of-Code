# Dataset
This code is for using training mask RCNN with pytorch and the [LabPics Version 2 datast](https://zenodo.org/record/4736111#.YpfnEqjMK3A).

# Requirement 
This demand pytorch 1.1 and opencv. Runnig it with newere pytorch version might cause some isseus.
Pytorch installation instructions are available at:
